# *Cis*-multivariable Mendelian randomization using robust PCA-GMM

R code to apply the methods discussed in "Robust use of phenotypic heterogeneity at drug target genes for mechanistic insights: application of cis-multivariable Mendelian randomization to GLP1R gene region"

* R code to run the method: PCA-GMM.R
* R code walkthrough to reproduce empirical findings: GLP1R-analysis.pdf
